# Weather App

The project was to implement a weather app that used API data and was styled according to one of two designs. 

## The problem

I used fetch at to endpoints to get the current data as well as the forecast for a location. If I had more time I would have liked to implement Geolocation and tweaked my searchbar to provide a better user experience.
